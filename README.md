# odin-recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This is a beginner-friendly web development project as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

In this project, I will be building a basic website to showcase a collection of delicious recipes. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

* **Basic HTML Structure:** Creating the fundamental layout and elements of web pages.
* **HTML Elements and Attributes:** Utilizing various HTML tags for content and their attributes for customization.
* **Working with Links and Images:** Implementing navigation between pages and embedding images.
* **Organizing Content:** Structuring the recipe content in a clear and readable manner.
* **Understanding File Paths:** Correctly linking to other HTML files and image assets.
* **Commiting Changes with Git:** Tracking progress and saving versions of the project.
* **Using Git for Local Version Control:** Managing changes within my local repository.

This project serves as a foundational step in my web development journey, solidifying my understanding of basic HTML. Let's get cooking!
