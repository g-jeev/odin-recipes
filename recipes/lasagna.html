    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the meat sauce: </strong> In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium-high heat. Drain off any excess fat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture: </strong> In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the Parmesan cheese. Mix well. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Noodles: </strong> In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the Parmesan cheese. Mix well. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat Oven: </strong> In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium-high heat. Drain off any excess fat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna: </strong> Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Bake: </strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and lightly browned.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest: </strong> Let the lasagna stand for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps it hold its shape. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
